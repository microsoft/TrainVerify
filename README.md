# TrainVerify 

## Introduction
**Overview:** TrainVerify is a verification tool to ensure *parallelization equivalence* in distributed model training. It guarantees that the parallelized model is arithmetically equivalent to its original single-device version, thereby eliminating errors such as incorrect tensor transformations or faulty collective communication introduced during parallelization.

**Workflow:** 
TrainVerify takes the *execution plans* (execplans) of both the original (single-device) and parallelized (multi-device) models, each enriched with *lineages*. It then transforms these into *symbolic SSA DAGs* (single-static assignment directed acyclic graphs). Such dual graphs are partitioned into independent *stages* using lineage information. Each stage undergoes parallel execution, where shape reduction is applied, followed by symbolic verification using Z3. If all stages pass, TrainVerify guarantees end-to-end equivalence.

**Implementation:** 
TrainVerify is implemented with modular interfaces. It defines a general graph interface and a solver interface, supporting a registry of allowable operators. The [*nnScaler*](https://github.com/microsoft/nnscaler) backend constructs SSA DAGs that conform to TrainVerify‚Äôs requirements. A high-level view of the implementation is shown below:

## Prepare for your Verification

### üíª Hardware Requirements
Most GPU machine could run below verification of example MLP model.
To verify large models such as Llama3(405B) and DeepSeek-V3(671B), we recommend to run TrainVerify on a machine with at least 32 CPU (virtual) cores and 1TB memory. 

## Installation
1. Clone the verification branch from nnscaler repo:
   ```
   cd TrainVerify
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/nnscaler.git -b verification
   ```
2. Create [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) environment.
    ```
    conda env create -f conda-environment.yml
    conda activate TrainVerify
    ```

3. Run demo verification for an example MLP model `gen_model/model/mlp.py` parallelization.
   
    1) Capture model graphs for verification
        ```
        cd Verdict;
        mkdir gen_model/mgeners;
        bash scripts/gen_mlp_demo.sh
        ```
    2) Perform verification
        ```
        mkdir data/logs;
        bash scripts/demo_mlp.sh 
        ```
        The `scripts/demo_mlp.sh` essentially runs the following command:
        ```
        python main.py \
            --sm gen_model/mgeners/mlp_default_dp1_pp1_tp1_nm1_gbs128_ly2_h0_hi128_sq0.pkl \ 
            --pm gen_model/mgeners/mlp_default_dp2_pp2_tp2_nm2_gbs128_ly2_h0_hi128_sq0.pkl \
            --seed 0 \
            --time \
            --max_ser_proc 30 \
            --max_vrf_proc 30 \
            --loglevel INFO \
            --no_cache_nodes \
            --no_cache_stages \
            |& tee -a data/logs/mlp_default_dp2_pp2_tp2_nm2_gbs128_ly2_h0_hi128_sq0.txt
        ```
        > Command interpretation: `main.py` is the entry of TrainVerify. `--sm` and `--pm` sepcify the paths of single-device model's and parallelized model's execution plan respectively. `--seed` sets z3 random seed. `--time` activates timer. `--max_ser_proc` and `--max_vrf_proc` set the multiprocessing pool size for building SSA DAGs, and parallel stage execution respectively. `--loglevel` sets logger level. `--no_cache_nodes` and `--no_cache_stages` ignore any cached data and run verification from scratch. `|& tee -a ...` writes logs to a file for inspection convenience.
        
        **üëÄ Expected Output:** The program should print the following message or similar at the bottom of the output. Indicating successful execution of all stages, as well as the verified end-to-end equivalence.
        ```
        PID: ... - ‚úÖ SUCCESS 
        Stats(success=True, ... )
        ```
        > A failed run would print `PID: ... - ‚ùå FAIL`.
4. Once the demo runs successfully, can proceed to verify your own models. We will continue to provide additional example model verifications in the future.
